// allocatedStateTracker maintains the set of devices consumed by the ResourceClaims in a
// Snapshot. The scheduler asks for this state in every PreFilter, that is once per pod
// placement attempt, and recomputing it means walking every claim and re-deriving every
// DeviceID. Between two consecutive attempts only a handful of claims change, so the state
// is instead maintained as claims are written and served directly.
//
// Time Complexities:
//   - apply(claimId, claim): O(D).
//   - withdraw(claimId): O(D), over the devices the claim contributed when applied.
//   - refresh(claimIds, lookup): O(P * D), driven by Snapshot.Revert.
//   - ensureBuilt(walkClaims): O(C * D) plus the cost of listing the claims on the
//     first read, O(1) on every read after that.
//   - allocatedState(): O(1) - the collections are handed over as they are.
//
// Variables used in complexity analysis:
//   - C: The number of ResourceClaims effective in the Snapshot.
//   - D: The number of allocated devices in a single ResourceClaim.
//   - P: The number of modified/deleted entries in a single patch layer.
//
// The work moved onto a write is bounded by the claim being written, never by the size of
// the Snapshot, and it takes the O(C * D) walk off every read but the first. Snapshot.Revert
// is the one operation where the tracker adds work proportional to something other than a
// single claim, and PatchSet.Revert is already O(P), so the refresh keeps it in the same
// complexity class with a larger constant.
//
// Withdrawing a claim cannot work by looking at its previous value: Snapshot mutates claims
// in place (see Snapshot.ensureClaimWritable, which hands back the stored object whenever the
// claim already lives in the current patch layer), so by the time a write reaches the tracker
// the old allocation may already be gone. The tracker therefore records what each claim
// contributed when it was applied, and withdraws exactly that.
//
// That in-place mutation is itself the subject of two open bugs - kubernetes-sigs/cluster-autoscaler#33,
// where a Pod referencing one claim through two aliases leaves the base layer dirty past a
// Revert, and #37, where the base layer holds the informer's own objects. Recording
// contributions rather than re-deriving them keeps the tracker consistent with whatever the
// claims currently say, so it stays correct however those two are eventually resolved.
//
// Entries are reference counted. A device should only ever be consumed by one claim, but
// refcounting means a duplicate does not make the device disappear from the state when just
// one of the claims goes away.
