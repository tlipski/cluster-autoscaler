// Borrowed collections
//
// ListAllAllocatedDevices and GatherAllocatedState hand back the snapshot's own live
// collections instead of copies. Copying them would put an O(allocated devices) walk back on
// a path the scheduler takes once per pod placement attempt, which is the cost this whole
// mechanism exists to remove, so the borrow is deliberate. It comes with two conditions on
// the caller:
//
//   - Read only. Writing through a returned collection corrupts the snapshot's derived
//     state, and nothing recomputes it.
//   - Valid until the next write. Any change to the snapshot's ResourceClaims - including
//     Fork, Commit and Revert - may mutate the collection in place. Callers that need a
//     value across a write have to call again afterwards, or copy it themselves.
//
// fwk.ResourceClaimTracker states neither condition, so this is a contract Cluster
// Autoscaler adds on top of the interface rather than one the interface grants. That is only
// sound because every caller is known and checked:
//
//   - k8s.io/dynamic-resource-allocation/structured, which is where the DRA scheduler plugin
//     sends the result. All three allocator variants (stable, incubating, experimental) and
//     structured.IsDeviceAllocated only ever read - Set.Has, len, range, map index.
//   - Cluster Autoscaler's own code, which does not call either method outside tests.
//
// TestSnapshotClaimTrackerBorrowedCollectionsAreReadOnly pins the first bullet down against
// the real allocator, so a Kubernetes bump that starts writing through the alias fails there
// instead of silently skewing the snapshot.
